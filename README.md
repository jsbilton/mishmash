###Create Circle

_As a user, I often eat with the same group of people from work. I want to define a circle of friends in order to make the process of deciding who is going to lunch easy. I desire an easy step by step process where I:_

Provide a name for the circle, such as "Co-workers" or "Family".
Search for friends in the Friends Directory and once found, add them to the circle.
See Manage Circle.

###Manage Circle

_As a user, I want to manage the friends in a specific Circle. I want to see a list of my Circles. After selecting a circle, two lists appear:_

A listing of existing friends that are in the selected circle.
An alphabetical listing of friends that are not in the circle.
Checking a name in the circle, moves the name outside the circle. Checking a name not in the circle, moves the name in the circle.

###Select Circle as Default

_As a user, I want to designate a specific circle as my default in order to streamline the process of activating a MishMash session._

###Search **OpenTable** Restaurant data

_As a user, I desire the ability to find a restaurant by:_

- [zip](http://opentable.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants?zip=29466)
- [price (and zip)](http://opentable.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants?zip=29464&price=2)
- [name](http://opentable.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants?name=red%20drum)

List the search results that include the restaurant name, address, and price rating (1-4). Selecting an item on the list displays an image of the restaurant, the location on a map, and restaurant name, address, and price.

Once I find a restaurant, I want the ability to create a reservation using **OpenTable**.

###Pick My Favs

###Activate MishMash Session

_As a user, I want the ability to easily decide on the best restaurant for lunch by simply shaking my phone or clicking a button. The system should suggest the best option based upon my preferences, friends preferences and session history. If I don't like that option, I can elect to view additional restaurant options. I want to pick the best option and save it to my session._

###Check In to Restaurant

_As a user, I want the app to know my current location and know when I am at the restaurant. I want the application to prompt me to:_

###Rate the restaurant

Mark or it as a favorite in my preferences
Block the restaurant in my preferences
Rate Restaurant During MishMash session

_As a user, I want to rate a restaurant during my session by providing a rating of 1 through 4. The system will save the rating for my current session and save the rating for the restaurant in my preferences._

###Mark Restaurant as Favorites

_As a user, while I am rating a restaurant, I can elect to save the restaurant as a favorite. As a result the system will save the restaurant in my preferences._

###Block a Restaurant

_As a user, there are certain restaurants that I do not like. I desire the ability to search for a restaurant and add it to preferences as a blocked restaurant._

###Send SMS to Friends

_As a user, I want the ability to easily tell my friends where to eat lunch. After activating a MishMash session, I want the ability to send a text to all the friends listed in my MishMash session._

###Up-vote Restaurant within MishMash session
